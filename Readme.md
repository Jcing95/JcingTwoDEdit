# Jcing TwoDEdit
##### A Two-Dimensional Game Editor by Jcing _[WIP]_

This is a Project i started in 2015 while studying Informatics.<br>
The Goal is a Two Dimensional Game Editor that is easy to use and quite perfomant whilst not using any native Libraries.<br>
It simply does not use them because I was not capable of using LWJGL that time.<br>
Maybe I will update this Project someday to use LWJGL.

At this Moment this Project is paused, because I'm working on a 3D Game Engine _with **LWJGL**_.


It uses some Third Party Ressources of some old Games i Played.<br>
